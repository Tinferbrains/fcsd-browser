# fcsd-browser
The minimal web browser that keeps you focused

Everyone's done it. Before you know it, you have twenty browsing tabs and you're nowhere near where you started. 
FCSD is a python-based browser with one goal: keep you focused.
There are only two requirements to run. 
1- Python 2.7
2- wxwidgets

When you run fcsd, it goes fullscreen immediately. 
The default home page is http://www.duckduckgo.com, but can be changed.

The keybindings are as follows:
The up key opens the "GOTO" dialog box, where you can enter a url.
The down key goes home.
The left key goes back.
The right key goes forward.
The f1 key shows the keybindings, in case you forget.
The f2 key lets you change the home page.
The escape key quits.

As you may notice, there are no "new tab" or "new window" functions. fcsd is designed to keep you focused on one task. If you want to multitask, fcsd is not for you.
